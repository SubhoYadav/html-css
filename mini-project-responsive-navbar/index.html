      <h1>2008 Financial Crisis</h1>
      <p>
        The Great Recession was a period of marked general decline observed in
        national economies globally, i.e. a recession, that occurred from late
        2007 to 2009. The scale and timing of the recession varied from country
        to country (see map).[1][2] At the time, the International Monetary Fund
        (IMF) concluded that it was the most severe economic and financial
        meltdown since the Great Depression. One result was a serious disruption
        of normal international relations. The causes of the Great Recession
        include a combination of vulnerabilities that developed in the financial
        system, along with a series of triggering events that began with the
        bursting of the United States housing bubble in 2005–2012.[3][4] When
        housing prices fell and homeowners began to abandon their mortgages, the
        value of mortgage-backed securities held by investment banks declined in
        2007–2008, causing several to collapse or be bailed out in September
        2008. This 2007–2008 phase was called the subprime mortgage crisis. The
        combination of banks unable to provide funds to businesses, and
        homeowners paying down debt rather than borrowing and spending, resulted
        in the Great Recession that began in the U.S. officially in December
        2007 and lasted until June 2009, thus extending over 19 months.[5][6] As
        with most other recessions, it appears that no known formal theoretical
        or empirical model was able to accurately predict the advance of this
        recession, except for minor signals in the sudden rise of forecast
        probabilities, which were still well under 50%.[7] The recession was not
        felt equally around the world; whereas most of the world's developed
        economies, particularly in North America, South America and Europe, fell
        into a severe, sustained recession, many more recently developed
        economies suffered far less impact, particularly China, India and
        Indonesia, whose economies grew substantially during this period.
        Similarly, Oceania suffered minimal impact, in part due to its proximity
        to Asian markets. The recession and crisis followed an extended period
        of expansion in US housing construction, home prices, and housing
        credit. This expansion began in the 1990s and continued unabated through
        the 2001 recession, accelerating in the mid-2000s. Average home prices
        in the United States more than doubled between 1998 and 2006, the
        sharpest increase recorded in US history, and even larger gains were
        recorded in some regions. Home ownership in this period rose from 64
        percent in 1994 to 69 percent in 2005, and residential investment grew
        from about 4.5 percent of US gross domestic product to about 6.5 percent
        over the same period. Roughly 40 percent of net private sector job
        creation between 2001 and 2005 was accounted for by employment in
        housing-related sectors. The expansion in the housing sector was
        accompanied by an expansion in home mortgage borrowing by US households.
        Mortgage debt of US households rose from 61 percent of GDP in 1998 to 97
        percent in 2006. A number of factors appear to have contributed to the
        growth in home mortgage debt. In the period after the 2001 recession,
        the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) maintained a low federal funds
        rate, and some observers have suggested that by keeping interest rates
        low for a “prolonged period” and by only increasing them at a “measured
        pace” after 2004, the Federal Reserve contributed to the expansion in
        housing market activity (Taylor 2007). However, other analysts have
        suggested that such factors can only account for a small portion of the
        increase in housing activity (Bernanke 2010). Moreover, the historically
        low level of interest rates may have been due, in part, to large
        accumulations of savings in some emerging market economies, which acted
        to depress interest rates globally (Bernanke 2005). Others point to the
        growth of the market for mortgage-backed securities as contributing to
        the increase in borrowing. Historically, it was difficult for borrowers
        to obtain mortgages if they were perceived as a poor credit risk,
        perhaps because of a below-average credit history or the inability to
        provide a large down payment. But during the early and mid-2000s,
        high-risk, or “subprime,” mortgages were offered by lenders who
        repackaged these loans into securities. The result was a large expansion
        in access to housing credit, helping to fuel the subsequent increase in
        demand that bid up home prices nationwide. After home prices peaked in
        the beginning of 2007, according to the Federal Housing Finance Agency
        House Price Index, the extent to which prices might eventually fall
        became a significant question for the pricing of mortgage-related
        securities because large declines in home prices were viewed as likely
        to lead to an increase in mortgage defaults and higher losses to holders
        of such securities. Large, nationwide declines in home prices had been
        relatively rare in the US historical data, but the run-up in home prices
        also had been unprecedented in its scale and scope. Ultimately, home
        prices fell by over a fifth on average across the nation from the first
        quarter of 2007 to the second quarter of 2011. This decline in home
        prices helped to spark the financial crisis of 2007-08, as financial
        market participants faced considerable uncertainty about the incidence
        of losses on mortgage-related assets. In August 2007, pressures emerged
        in certain financial markets, particularly the market for asset-backed
        commercial paper, as money market investors became wary of exposures to
        subprime mortgages (Covitz, Liang, and Suarez 2009). In the spring of
        2008, the investment bank Bear Stearns was acquired by JPMorgan Chase
        with the assistance of the Federal Reserve. In September, Lehman
        Brothers filed for bankruptcy, and the next day the Federal Reserve
        provided support to AIG, a large insurance and financial services
        company. Citigroup and Bank of America sought support from the Federal
        Reserve, the Treasury, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
